# CF-Simulator

Attempt to simulate the colored ferret room in Runescape 3's Dungeoneering "minigame". Ferret reactions are off by a tick.\
My first big programming project, first introduction to Pygame and object orientation, so the code is naturally very messy. Implementation of A* algorithm for the user's movement was heavily helped by [this Stanford paper](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/AStarComparison.html).
